# How to run it
Just go to __https://elodin77.github.io/CYOA/__ and you can see it for yourself. Alternatively you could download/clone this and then open up the index.html file locally to play offline, although this isn't always reliable.

# CYOA
Choose Your Own Adventure collection. This is a project I made in my spare time, it turns normal CYOA books into an interactive game. I made this in a single day, with multiple small updates since then.

# If you want to add your own
You can totally make your own stores. Just send me a message through Discord on Elodin#3222 and I will be able to add you as an owner for your particular story file on this repository. You will have full permissions over the file. Even if you just have the raw copy of a CYOA, with my Regex magic, I will be able to convert it to the format this program can understand. So if you have a good idea, you can definitely do one yourself.
