# CYOA
Choose Your Own Adventure collection. This is a project I made in my spare time, it turns normal CYOA books into an interactive game you can play at https://elodin77.github.io/CYOA/.

# If you want me to add your own
You won't necessarily need to format it properly. I am reasonably skilled at regex so I can probably convert the raw copy of the book into a formatted copy. But if you really want to format your own, you can look at the current formatted stories to learn how it is done. Because as of right now I haven't written a guide for it.
