This is an original story written by me, Elodin77.

You pick up your diary. You begin to write.

Day 1 
^ I went outside the walls to hunt,2
^ I went over to the market to do some work,3
I'm different. I can see things other people can't see, 
I can do things others can't do. I don't know why, but I want 
to find out. I want to know who I am.  

Yesterday there was barely anybody in the market, none of them 
were rich so my haul was pathetic. It's been like this for a while, 
something must be happening in the castle. There are hardly any 
patrols too, which makes it easier. They put me in prison once, I 
got out though so it was alright. 
I might be able to go outside the walls to hunt today, the weather 
looks like it'll rain, so my tracks will be covered. Those soldiers 
have been hunting me ever since I escaped.
