        This is a program which I have coded in my spare time. If you find any bugs or far more importantly, have your own story
        that you want me to add. I would happy to add it, I also have some skills at Regex, meaning that you can probably give me the story
        in its raw format (without special formatting) and I will be able to convert it using some fancy code. You can contact me through
        Discord with Elodin#9199.<br /><br />
        A full list of adventures can be found <a href="https://github.com/Elodin77/CYOA/tree/master/adventures">here</a>.<br />
        Sometimes you may need to reload the page a few times if the adventure doesn't load. Otherwise you should
        check that the file name you specified is a valid file.<br /><br />
